~/ebooks
=================

##[Welcome message]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to lx-zero.github.io/ebooks, this section is where I put the
ebooks that I will learn and write about.

When I actually have a job, I'll buy these books if I can and if I liked it.

##[Why is the first level header called `~/ebooks`?]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's understood where it came from and like the `~/entries` section, I need
to make the directories shorter as possible.
