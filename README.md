##[Welcome message]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to lx-zero.github.io, this repository is where I put my *personal*
stuff.

(07-12-2014 : Sat 20:44 > V1)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I *plan* to make a personal website *by scratch* in the future but for now,
I intend to write a diary in `~/entries/` section. I plan to start writing about my experiences in learning from a book
called "The C Programming Language Second Edition (ANSI C)" soon.

##[What is lx-zero?]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has three meanings but two are only discussed in-depth which are:
lx-zero as an alias and as a big personal repository

As an alias, it's a combination of "LeX", the shortest version of my name and "zero" indicating nothing since I just thought
of adding an extra word to make the username acceptable separated by a dash indicating a space.

You may refer lx-zero as lxz, lxzero, zero-lx, zerolx, zlx or just lx-zero. Your choice.

As a big personal repository, it's where my personal stuff is stored. Why put my personal stuff in the public, you ask? Well
I plan create a personal site using github pages and I only share what I want the world to know about me.

The third meaning is that it's a directory like `lx-zero.github.io/x` where x is a section I plan to put on the site. 
This meaning varies depending on the section you're viewing.

##[Why make a repository?]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mostly plan to make a personal website/blog hybrid but my HTML and CSS
skills are a bit rusty, I lacked knowledge of web development fundamentals and I lacked time and motivation to do so.

##[Who are your audiences?]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone interested to know who I am and what I learn.

##[What operating system are you using?]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debian Linux 7 Wheezy [07-12-2014 - PRESENT]
