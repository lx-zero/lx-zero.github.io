##[Welcome message]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the `ANSI-C` section, it's where I write about experiences in
the book called "The C Programming Language Second Edition (ANSI C)"

You might say that it's called **"K & R C"** not **ANSI C** well it's really called **ANSI C**. The **K & R C** is the
first edition of the book which is older.

You might ask "Why choose ANSI C instead of K & R C?" well that's because ANSI C is newer and a superset of c, it has no
difference except the functions.

Another reason is that I need to choose a programming language that is still widely used in 2014 (The year this entry is
written) and the upcoming future. ANSI C is newer and more widely used than K & R C but I respect both versions.

##[Sections]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section is, again separated by sections which are:

<ol>
  <li>programs  - section where non-exercise code is stored for reference.</li>
  <li>exercises - section where exercises are done.</li>
  <li>topics    - section where I actually write about something.</li>
</ol>
