##[Welcome message]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to lx-zero.github.io/entries, this section is where I write about 
something I am interested in. Specifically, I write about my experiences, opionions and tips to succeed in that topic.

##[Why is the first level header called `~/entries`]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's understood where it came from and I need to make the directory as short
as possible.
