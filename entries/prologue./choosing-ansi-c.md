Choosing ANSI C
===========================

Some of you guys will wonder "what is ANSI C?", ANSI C is a standard published by the American National Standard Institute 
in 1990, I could've chosen C11 but I am interested in the book called
["The C Programin Language Second Edition (ANSI C)"]["CBOOK"] because of it's simplicity and how it's built-in Linux Debian 
7 Wheezy after installing all the official packages offered during the setup.

I could've also chosen K & R C but it's older and a subset of ANSI C but I respect both standards, it's just that ANSI C
is more widely used than K & R C.

According to the preface:

> This Second Edition of The C Programming Language describes C as defined by the ANSI
> standard. Although we have noted the places where the language has evolved, we have chosen
> to write exclusively in the new form. **For the most part, this makes no significant difference;
> the most visible change is the new form of function declaration and definition. Modern
> compilers already support most features of the standard.**

I think it's time to get started with the first topic on the first chapter.
