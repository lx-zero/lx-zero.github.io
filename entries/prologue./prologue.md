=================

Dear reader,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome you to lx-zero, my personal repository with a diary and blog where
you're in now called `~/entries`.

This text file has been made to introduce a lot of things concerning this personal repository.

As of this time, I can't reveal my real name because I am still unsure whether if I should continue writing or not.
I need to keep writing until January 2015 since that's the only time I need for this section. What I can reveal howver is
that I am a 15 year old teenager curious to tackle programming and the academic subjects that is relevant to it.

I made a blog/diary hybrid because of the following:

<ol>
  <li>I have my own set of goals to finish that will determine if I should continue this activity or not.</li>
  <li>My reading and writing skills are rusty. Since I am a kinesthetic learner, I belive that the best way to enhance these
  skills is to actually *write* a blog and *read* it. I also decided that reading ebooks will help me do that and learn a
  new skill, it's like two birds and one stone</li>
  <li>To keep me away from distractions and keep track of my goals which motivates me to do more.</li>
</ol>

In order to begin, I am going to learn programming by reading ["The C Programming Language Second Edition (ANSI C)"][1] then
writing code and something about what I learn. I'll provide the resource if I can. There's an [ebook][2] section where I put
what I read and will write about.

I have previous programming experience but it's a little rusty and I want to learn in a challenging way.

My goal is to learn C and Python. For now, I'll learn C and learn Python in September since there will be a [course][3] 
that will let me learn while writing games.
